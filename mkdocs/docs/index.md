### Guido Music Notation

The GUIDO Music Notation Format (GMN) is a general purpose formal language for representing score level
music in a platform independent, plain-text and human-readable way. It is based on a conceptually
simple but powerful formalism: its design concentrates on general musical concepts (as opposed to
notational, i.e, graphical features). A key feature of the GUIDO design is adequacy, which means
that simple musical concepts should be represented in a simple way and only complex notions
require complex representations.

GUIDO supports most of the commonly used concepts of conventional music
notation; however, it is designed to be a flexible and easily extendable open standard. Various extensions of the Basic GUIDO Notation Format include mechanisms for representing musical structure,
abstract scores, micro-tonal music, and generalized timed events (for multi-media support).

GUIDO has not been developed with a particular application in mind but to provide an adequate
representation formalism for score-level music over a broad range of applications. The intended
application areas include notation software, compositional and analytical systems and tools, large
musical databases, performance systems, and music on the World Wide Web.

The GUIDO Music Notation Format has been developed by Holger H. Hoos, *Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany* and Keith Hamel, *University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada*; some features are based on discussions with Michael Fuhlbrugge, Kai Flade, Thomas Helbich and Jurgen
Kilian. It is named after [Guido d'Arezzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_of_Arezzo) (990-1050), a renowned music theorist of his time and
important contributor to today's conventional musical notation (CMN). His achievements include
the perfection of the staff system for music notation and the invention of solmisation (solfege).
